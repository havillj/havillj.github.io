<!--
Although I am new to Bucknell, I have been teaching computer science since I earned my Ph.D. from The College of William and Mary in 1998.



I graduated from Bucknell "many years ago" with majors in Computer Science and Religion.  

I live in Lewisburg with my family and an overly protective little dog named Sully.
