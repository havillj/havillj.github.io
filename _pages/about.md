I am passionate about teaching Computer Science and exploring connections between computing and other discplines.  I invite you to explore the tabs above to learn more about my work.

<!-- 
Although I am a new member of the Bucknell Faculty, I am not new to Bucknell, having graduated from here a "few" years ago with majors in Computer Science and Religion.  

I live in Lewisburg with my family and an overly protective little dog named Sully.
